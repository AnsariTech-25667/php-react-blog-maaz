Technical Architecture
DevCanvas is built upon a well-defined layered architecture, ensuring clear separation of concerns, optimal performance, and future scalability.

Frontend: React.js
The user interface is a dynamic Single Page Application (SPA) built with React.js. This choice was driven by React's component-based paradigm, which facilitates efficient UI rendering, state management, and the creation of highly interactive web experiences.

React Router DOM: Manages declarative, client-side routing, enabling seamless and fast navigation between different application views without full page reloads.

Axios: Employed as the primary HTTP client for making clean, promise-based API requests to the PHP backend, simplifying asynchronous data fetching.

Modular Component Design: The UI is systematically organized into reusable and self-contained components (e.g., Auth/, Blog/, Common/), significantly enhancing code reusability, maintainability, and testability.

Backend: PHP 8.3
The server-side logic is powered by a robust PHP 8.3 RESTful API. PHP was selected for its mature ecosystem, significant performance enhancements in its modern versions, and its proven capability in building reliable and scalable web services.

Composer: Serves as the essential dependency manager for PHP, streamlining the inclusion and management of crucial backend libraries.

phpdotenv: Utilized for securely loading environment variables from a .env file, a critical practice for keeping sensitive data (such as database credentials and API keys) out of version control.

firebase/php-jwt: Integrated for robust JSON Web Token (JWT) encoding and decoding, enabling stateless and secure user authentication across API requests.

bcrypt: Employed for strong, one-way password hashing, providing industry-standard security for storing user credentials in the database.

PDO (PHP Data Objects): All database interactions are exclusively performed using PDO, which offers a consistent interface and, crucially, supports parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Database: MySQL 8.x
Data persistence is managed by MySQL 8.x, a leading open-source relational database management system.

Relational Schema: A clear and normalized schema (users and posts tables) is designed, incorporating PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints to ensure data integrity and efficient relationships between entities.

Comprehensive Sample Data: The database/blog_app_db.sql file is meticulously populated with 10 diverse users (including authentic Indian names and realistic bios) and 20 varied blog posts. This rich dataset makes the application immediately impressive and functional upon setup, reflecting a real-world populated system.

Key Design Decisions & Best Practices
My development process for DevCanvas was rigorously guided by a commitment to modern software engineering principles:

Security-First Development:

Data Protection: Prioritized user data security through bcrypt for password hashing and secure token-based authentication.

API Security: Implemented robust CORS configurations and JWT validation to protect API endpoints from unauthorized access and cross-site scripting attacks.

SQL Injection Prevention: Exclusively used PDO with prepared statements for all database queries, eliminating a common web vulnerability.

Modular & Maintainable Codebase:

Clear Separation of Concerns: Distinct responsibilities for frontend UI, backend business logic, and database interactions ensure a highly organized and manageable codebase.

Consistent Structure: Adhered to a logical folder and file naming convention across both React and PHP, making the project intuitive to navigate and understand.

Performance & Scalability Considerations:

Efficient Data Retrieval: Optimized database queries with appropriate JOIN operations and ORDER BY clauses to ensure fast data fetching for the public feed and user profiles.

Stateless Authentication: JWTs minimize server-side overhead, contributing to better scalability.

User-Centric UI/UX:

Responsive Design: Ensured optimal viewing and interaction across all device sizes, from mobile phones to large desktops.

Aesthetic Appeal: Employed a clean, modern design with a calming color palette, professional typography (Inter and Poppins fonts), subtle gradients, and refined shadows to enhance visual appeal and readability. The inclusion of decorative images on the homepage adds to the visual richness.

Development Journey & Problem Solving
The development of DevCanvas was a hands-on learning experience, involving systematic problem-solving:

Environment Setup Complexities: Navigating the intricacies of local development environments, including configuring Apache Virtual Hosts in Laragon, managing the Windows hosts file, and resolving persistent npm dependency installation issues (e.g., "no space left on device" errors) and react-scripts execution problems. Each challenge required diligent research, precise command-line execution, and a methodical approach to debugging.

API Connectivity Troubleshooting: Meticulously debugging cross-origin communication between the React frontend and PHP backend, including fine-tuning CORS headers and ensuring the PHP autoloader correctly located necessary classes. This involved a deep dive into HTTP request/response cycles and PHP's class loading mechanisms.

These challenges, while demanding, significantly enhanced my troubleshooting skills and reinforced the importance of a systematic approach to development.
